# Computer Pointer Controller

This is a stripped down version of my submission of the final project (logging and
benchmarking code removed) from Udacity's [Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree Program][nanodegree].
This project uses a inference engine pipeline involving 4 OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit Pre-Trained
Models to capture the direction at which a person's eye is looking at to move the location
of the mouse pointer.

## How it Works

This project uses InferenceEngine API from Intel's OpenVino ToolKit to run the inference using
the gaze estimation model from Intel's OpenVino Pre-Trained Model Zoo. The gaze estimation
model requires three inputs:

* The head pose
* The left eye image
* The right eye image.

To get these inputs, we have to use three other OpenVino models:

* [Face Detection][face-detection-adas-binary-0001]
* [Head Pose Estimation][head-pose-estimation-adas-0001]
* [Facial Landmarks Detection][landmarks-regression-retail-0009]

## The Pipeline

The flow of data will look like this:

![Project Pipeline][img-pipeline]

## Getting Started

Before you use anything from this repository for any of your Udacity project submission
make sure you abide by [Udacity Honor Code][honor-code] to avoid penalty from Udacity.

1. Install Openvino Toolkit latest version along with it's dependencies.
2. Open a terminal window and initialize OpenVINO environment (setupvars).
3. Clone this repository, create a virtual environment for it and activate it.
4. Install pip dependencies, command: `yarn` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Download following openvino models via openvino model downloader to your desired location.
you can also use the default intel openvino model directory.
    * [face-detection-adas-binary-0001][face-detection-adas-binary-0001]
    * [head-pose-estimation-adas-0001][head-pose-estimation-adas-0001]
    * [landmarks-regression-retail-0009][landmarks-regression-retail-0009]
    * [gaze-estimation-adas-0002][gaze-estimation-adas-0002]
6. Take a note of the directory where you downloaded your models.

## Running the App

To start the app, just run `yarn start` or `python src/main.py`, this will run the inference
on your webcam feed with CPU device and FP32 precision and models from default openvino
model install location on windows. For other locations of model download directory you
can use `--model-dir` command line switch to pass the absolute path of the directory.

To customize the app you can use the following command line arguments:

```plain
--model-dir     Path to intel model deirectory e.g ...openvino_models/models/intel
--device        Device for running inference e.g CPU GPU etc.
--precision     Precision FP32, FP16 or INT8 only.
--input-type    Input Type cam, video or image only.
--input-file    Input video or image file absolute path.
```

Run `yarn start --help` to see all available command line switches.

## Directory Structure

The following are the important files and directories within project src directory

```plain
main.py                Contains the app
app_args.py            Command line arguments builder
models                 Directory of model classes
input_feeder.py        Feeds the input image, video to model
mouse_controller.py    Controls mouse pointer using pyautogui
```

## Async Inference

Just using the `start_async` method for inference does not make it an async inference if
you wait for it. In other words if you are waiting for an operation to complete it's not
an async operation.

In this project async inference was used to run facial_landmarks_detection and
head_pose_estimation simultaneously to reduce the inference time.

## Contributing

I could not apply async inference to the whole pipeline, if you wanna share your ideas
feel free to open an issue about it, PR's are welcome too.
